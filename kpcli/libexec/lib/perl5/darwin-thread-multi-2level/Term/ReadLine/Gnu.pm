=head1 NAME

Term::ReadLine::Gnu - Perl extension for the GNU Readline/History Library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Term::ReadLine;	# Do not "use Term::ReadLine::Gnu;"
  $term = new Term::ReadLine 'ProgramName';
  while ( defined ($_ = $term->readline('prompt>')) ) {
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Overview

This is an implementation of
L<Term::ReadLine|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ReadLine/> using
L<the GNU ReadlineE<sol>History
Library|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html>.

For basic functions object oriented interface is provided. These are
described in the section L</"Standard Methods"> and
L</"C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> Functions">.

This package also has the interface with the almost all functions and
variables which are documented in the GNU Readline/History Library
Manual.  They are documented in the section
L</"C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> Functions">
and
L</"C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>
Variables"> briefly.  For further details of the GNU Readline/History
Library, see L<GNU Readline Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html> and
L<GNU History Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/history.html>.

There are some C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> original features.  They are
described in the section L</"C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> Specific
Features">

The sample programs under F<eg/> directory and test programs under
F<t/> directory in L<the C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> distribution|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ReadLine-Gnu/> include
many examples of this module.

=head2 Standard Methods

These are standard methods defined by
L<Term::ReadLine|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ReadLine/>.

=item C<ReadLine>

returns the actual package that executes the commands. If
this package is being used, C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> is returned.

=cut

sub ReadLine { 'Term::ReadLine::Gnu'; }

=item C<new(NAME,[IN,OUT])>

returns the handle for subsequent calls to following functions.
Argument is the name of the application.  Optionally can be followed
by two arguments for C<IN> and C<OUT> file handles. These arguments
should be globs.

=item C<readline(PROMPT[,PREPUT])>

gets an input line, with actual C<GNU Readline> support.  Trailing
newline is removed.  Returns C<undef> on C<EOF>.  C<PREPUT> is an
optional argument meaning the initial value of input.

The optional argument C<PREPUT> is granted only if the value C<preput>
is in C<Features>.

C<PROMPT> may include some escape sequences.  Use
C<RL_PROMPT_START_IGNORE> to begin a sequence of non-printing
characters, and C<RL_PROMPT_END_IGNORE> to end the sequence.

=item C<AddHistory(LINE1, LINE2, ...)>

adds the lines to the history of input, from where it can be used if
the actual C<readline> is present.

=cut

sub AddHistory {

=item C<IN>, C<OUT>

return the file handles for input and output or C<undef> if
C<readline> input and output cannot be used for Perl.

=cut

sub IN  { $Attribs{instream}; }
sub OUT { $Attribs{outstream}; }

=item C<MinLine([MAX])>

If argument C<MAX> is specified, it is an advice on minimal size of
line to be included into history.  C<undef> means do not include
anything into history.  Returns the old value.

=cut

sub MinLine {
    my $self = shift;
    my $old_minlength = $self->{MinLength};
    $self->{MinLength} = shift;
    $old_minlength;
}

=item C<findConsole>

returns an array with two strings that give most appropriate names for
files for input and output using conventions C<"E<lt>$in">, C<"E<gt>$out">.

=cut

# findConsole is defined in ReadLine.pm.

=item C<Attribs>

returns a reference to a hash which describes internal configuration
(variables) of the package.  Names of keys in this hash conform to
standard conventions with the leading C<rl_> stripped.

See section L</"C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> Variables"> for supported variables.

=cut

sub Attribs { \%Attribs; }

=item C<Features>

Returns a reference to a hash with keys being features present in
current implementation. Several optional features are used in the
minimal interface: C<appname> should be present if the first argument
to C<new> is recognized, and C<minline> should be present if
C<MinLine> method is not dummy.  C<autohistory> should be present if
lines are put into history automatically (maybe subject to
C<MinLine>), and C<addHistory> if C<AddHistory> method is not dummy. 
C<preput> means the second argument to C<readline> method is processed.
C<getHistory> and C<setHistory> denote that the corresponding methods are 
present. C<tkRunning> denotes that a Tk application may run while ReadLine
is getting input.

=cut

sub Features { \%Features; }

=item C<tkRunning>

makes Tk event loop run when waiting for user input (i.e., during
C<readline> method).

=cut

# tkRunning is defined in ReadLine.pm.

=item C<event_loop>

See the description of C<event_loop> on
L<Term::ReadLine|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ReadLine/>.

=item C<ornaments>

makes the command line stand out by using termcap data.  The argument
to C<ornaments> should be 0, 1, or a string of a form
C<"aa,bb,cc,dd">.  Four components of this string should be names of
I<terminal capacities>, first two will be issued to make the prompt
standout, last two to make the input line standout.

=cut

sub ornaments {
    my $self = shift;
    return Term::ReadLine::Gnu::XS::ornaments(@_);
}

=item C<newTTY>

takes two arguments which are input filehandle and output filehandle.
Switches to use these filehandles.

=cut

# used by a program (ex. perldb5.pl) who changes input/output stream.
sub newTTY {
    my ($self, $in, $out) = @_;

    # borrowed from Term/ReadLine.pm
    my $sel = select($out);
    $| = 1;			# for DB::OUT
    select($sel);

    $Attribs{instream}  = $in;
    $Attribs{outstream} = $out;
}

=item C<enableUTF8>

Enables UTF-8 support.

If STDIN is in UTF-8 by the C<-C> command-line switch or
C<PERL_UNICODE> environment variable, or C<IN> file handle has C<utf8>
IO layer, then UTF-8 support is also enabled.  In other cases you need
this C<enableUTF8> method.

This is an original method of C<Term::ReadLine:Gnu>.

=cut

sub enableUTF8 {
    my $self = shift;
    $Attribs{utf8_mode} = 1;
    binmode $self->IN,  ':encoding(UTF-8)'; # not necessary

=head2 C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> Functions

All these GNU Readline/History Library functions supported are callable via
method interface and have names which conform to standard conventions
with the leading C<rl_> stripped.  For example C<rl_foo()>
function is called as C<$term-E<gt>foo()>.

The titles of the following sections are same as the titles of the
corresponding sections in the "Programming with GNU Readline" section
in the L<GNU Readline Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html>.
Refer them for further details.

Although it is preferred to use method interface, most methods have
lower level functions in
C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu::XS> package.  To use them a full qualified name
is required.

=head3 Basic Behavior

The function C<readline()> prints a prompt and then reads and returns
a single line of text from the user.

	$_ = $term->readline('Enter a line: ');

You can change key-bindings using C<bind_key(KEY, FUNCTION [,MAP])>
function.  The first argument, C<KEY>, is the character that you want
bind.  The second argument, C<FUNCTION>, is the function to call when
C<KEY> is pressed.  The C<FUNCTION> can be a reference to a Perl
function (see L</"Custom Functions">) or a "named function" named by
C<add_defun()> function or commands described in the "Bindable
Readline Commands" section in the L<GNU Readline Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html>.

	$term->bind_key(ord "\ci, 'tab-insert');

The above example binds Control-I to the 'tab-insert' command.

=head3 Custom Functions

You can write new functions using Perl.  The calling sequence for a
command foo looks like

	sub foo ($count, $key) { ... }

where C<$count> is the numeric argument (or 1 if defaulted) and
C<$key> is the key that invoked this function.

Here is an example;

	sub reverse_line {		# reverse a whole line
	    my($count, $key) = @_;	# ignored in this sample function
    	
	    $t->modifying(0, $a->{end}); # save undo information
	    $a->{line_buffer} = reverse $a->{line_buffer};
	}

See the "Writing a New Function" section in the L<GNU Readline Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html> for
further details.

=head3 Readline Convenience Functions

=head4 Naming a Function

=over 4

=item C<add_defun(NAME, FUNCTION [,KEY=-1])>

Add name to a Perl function C<FUNCTION>.  If optional argument C<KEY>
is specified, bind it to the C<FUNCTION>.  Returns reference to
C<FunctionPtr>.

  Example:
	# name `reverse-line' to a function reverse_line(),
	# and bind it to "\C-t"
	$term->add_defun('reverse-line', \&reverse_line, ord "\ct");

=head2 Custom Completion

In this section variables and functions for custom completion are
described along with examples.

Most of descriptions in this section came from L<GNU Readline
Library
Manual|http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html>.

=over 4

=item C<completion_entry_function>

This variable holds reference refers to a generator function for
C<completion_matches()>.

A generator function is called repeatedly from
C<completion_matches()>, returning a string each time.  The arguments
to the generator function are C<TEXT> and C<STATE>.  C<TEXT> is the
partial word to be completed.  C<STATE> is zero the first time the
function is called, allowing the generator to perform any necessary
initialization, and a positive non-zero integer for each subsequent
call.  When the generator function returns C<undef> this signals
C<completion_matches()> that there are no more possibilities left.

If this variable set to undef, built-in C<filename_completion_function> is
used.

A sample generator function, C<list_completion_function>, is defined
in Gnu.pm.  You can use it as follows;

    use Term::ReadLine;
    ...
    my $term = new Term::ReadLine 'sample';
    my $attribs = $term->Attribs;
    ...
    $attribs->{completion_entry_function} =
	$attribs->{list_completion_function};
    ...
    $attribs->{completion_word} =
	[qw(reference to a list of words which you want to use for completion)];
    $term->readline("custom completion>");

See also C<completion_matches>.

=item C<attempted_completion_function>

A reference to an alternative function to create matches.

The function is called with C<TEXT>, C<LINE_BUFFER>, C<START>, and
C<END>.  C<LINE_BUFFER> is a current input buffer string.  C<START>
and C<END> are indices in C<LINE_BUFFER> saying what the boundaries of
C<TEXT> are.

If this function exists and returns null list or C<undef>, or if this
variable is set to C<undef>, then an internal function
C<rl_complete()> will call the value of
C<completion_entry_function> to generate matches, otherwise the
array of strings returned will be used.

The default value of this variable is C<undef>.  You can use it as follows;

    use Term::ReadLine;
    ...
    my $term = new Term::ReadLine 'sample';
    my $attribs = $term->Attribs;
    ...
    sub sample_completion {
        my ($text, $line, $start, $end) = @_;
        # If first word then username completion, else filename completion
        if (substr($line, 0, $start) =~ /^\s*$/) {
    	    return $term->completion_matches($text,
					     $attribs->{'username_completion_function'});
        } else {
    	    return ();
        }
    }
    ...
    $attribs->{attempted_completion_function} = \&sample_completion;

=item C<completion_matches(TEXT, ENTRY_FUNC)>

Returns an array of strings which is a list of completions for
C<TEXT>.  If there are no completions, returns C<undef>.  The first
entry in the returned array is the substitution for C<TEXT>.  The
remaining entries are the possible completions.

C<ENTRY_FUNC> is a generator function which has two arguments, and
returns a string.  The first argument is C<TEXT>.  The second is a
state argument; it is zero on the first call, and non-zero on
subsequent calls.  C<ENTRY_FUNC> returns C<undef> to the caller when
there are no more matches.

If the value of C<ENTRY_FUNC> is undef, built-in
C<filename_completion_function> is used.

C<completion_matches> is a Perl wrapper function of an internal
function C<completion_matches()>.  See also
C<completion_entry_function>.

=item C<completion_function>

A variable whose content is a reference to a function which returns a
list of candidates to complete.

This variable is compatible with L<Term::ReadLine::Perl|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ReadLine-Perl/> and very easy
to use.

    use Term::ReadLine;
    ...
    my $term = new Term::ReadLine 'sample';
    my $attribs = $term->Attribs;
    ...
    $attribs->{completion_function} = sub {
	my ($text, $line, $start) = @_;
	return qw(a list of candidates to complete);
    };

=item C<list_completion_function(TEXT, STATE)>

A sample generator function defined by C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>.
Example code at C<completion_entry_function> shows how to use this
function.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<~/.inputrc>

Readline init file.  Using this file it is possible that you would
like to use a different set of key bindings.  When a program which
uses the GNU Readline library starts up, the init file is read, and
the key bindings are set.

The conditional init constructs is supported.  The program name which is
specified by the first argument of C<new> method is used as the
application construct.

For example, when your program calls C<new> method as follows;

	...
	$term = new Term::ReadLine 'PerlSh';
	...

your F<~/.inputrc> can define key bindings only for the program as
follows;

	...
	$if PerlSh
	Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
	"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
        "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"
	$endif
